A free events calendar with built in ticketing that lets you easily add your events and sell tickets, directly on your website

== Description ==

The Line-Up Wordpress Events Calendar lets you easily list events and sell tickets on your Wordpress site.  With the Line-Up plugin there is no need to use both an event calendar and a separate ticketing service; you can stop sending your customers away from your site to buy tickets.  With Line-Up you control your ticketing.

If a customer arrived at your event, you wouldn't send them down the street to buy a ticket!  So why do it online.  With Line-Up you can sell tickets directly on your website with simplicity and ease.

The Line-Up Wordpress Events Calendar combines clean customizable design, easy to use functionality and a comprehensive set of features that ensures your users get the best experience.  It’s incredibly easy to add and manage your events and all features are included for free. When you want to sell tickets to an event, we’ll add a small booking fee to each ticket which you can choose to pass on to your customer if you wish.  There's no booking fee for free tickets.

To use the Line-Up events calendar plugin simply create an account with [Line-Up](https://lineupnow.com/user/signup?utm_source=wppl&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=plugin), add the plugin to your Wordpress console and add the calendar short code to the page where you want it to appear.  Then simply create your events and tickets in you Line-Up account and they will appear in your events calendar.

Line-Up is a proven event listings, management, and ticketing platform that is used by many major media companies across the UK, Ireland and US on over 300 websites, including Trinity Mirror, Local World, Johnston Press, Bauer Media, Metro US.
To date, over 16,000 event promoters have uploaded 50,000+ events to the Line-Up platform.

_"I had an existing events calendar on my Wordpress site but I was having issues with it not being very user friendly.  I saw the Line-Up option and thought this would be a great solution to that and save me time as there won’t be any double inputting as the ticketing was built in as well. It was a no brainer!"_

_"The Line-Up events calendar plugin makes it so easy to list our events and sell tickets on our website.”_
David, [Jazz.coop](http://jazz.coop/whats-on/)

​_"The Line-Up system allows me to upload an event and tickets and then stream it through to our website.  Previously we were using Eventbrite but I changed to Line-Up due to its integrated ticketing system that makes my site more accessible for clients to use.  Adding the Wordpress plugin to my site was as easy as copying and pasting a code into Wordpress - took less than 5 minutes."_
